# Testing Architecture

## TDD Enforcement Overview

TDD enforcement applies to all packages with `"tdd": { "enabled": true }` in their `package.json`. Packages without this marker are exempt until a migration plan lands.

### Rule 12 — xfail-first (CLAUDE.md §12)

Any implementation commit in a TDD-enabled package must be preceded on the same branch by a commit adding an xfail test. The xfail test must carry a comment `# xfail: <task-id-or-plan-path>`.

**Enforcement:**
- Client-side: `scripts/hooks/pre-push-tdd.sh` (walks commits, blocks push on violation)
- Server-side (authoritative): `.github/workflows/tdd-gate.yml` job `xfail-first`
- Bypass: `TDD-Waiver: <reason>` trailer on the tip commit (Duong only)

**xfail annotations recognised (canonical per-framework APIs):**
- Vitest: `it.fails` — **NOT** `it.failing` (that is Playwright's API; Vitest will throw TypeError)
- Playwright: `test.fail`
- pytest: `@pytest.mark.xfail`
- Shell/bats: `# xfail:` comment

**Verification step:** after seeding an xfail, run `npm run test:unit` locally and confirm the xfail file appears in the test count with status "failing as expected". If the test count doesn't include it, the API is wrong or the file is excluded by the vitest config.

### Rule 13 — Regression test required for bug fixes (CLAUDE.md §13)

Commits with `bug`, `bugfix`, `regression`, or `hotfix` in the subject line must be accompanied by a regression test commit on the same branch.

**Enforcement:**
- Client-side: `scripts/hooks/pre-push-tdd.sh` job `regression-test` check
- Server-side (authoritative): `.github/workflows/tdd-gate.yml` job `regression-test`
- Bypass: `TDD-Waiver: <reason>` or `TDD-Trivial: <reason>` trailer (Duong only; `TDD-Trivial` only for `docs/**` and `**/*.md` paths)

### Rule 14 — Pre-commit unit tests (CLAUDE.md §14)

On every `git commit`, unit tests run for staged TDD-enabled packages. Commit is blocked on failure.

**Enforcement:**
- `scripts/hooks/pre-commit-unit-tests.sh` (installed by `scripts/install-hooks.sh`)
- Looks for `package.json#scripts["test:unit"]` in each affected package
- Agents may never pass `--no-verify`

### Rule 15 — E2E on every PR (CLAUDE.md §15)

Every PR to `main` runs the full Playwright E2E suite. Red check blocks merge.

**Enforcement:**
- `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` — required check via branch protection
- Runs only when TDD-enabled packages are touched; green no-op otherwise
- Retries: 2 (configured in Playwright)

### Rule 16 — QA agent report required for UI PRs (CLAUDE.md §16)

For PRs touching `apps/*/src/**` or `dashboards/*/src/**`, the PR body must include `QA-Report: <url>`.

**Enforcement:**
- `.github/workflows/pr-lint.yml` job `qa-report-present` — required check via branch protection
- Bypass: `QA-Waiver: <reason>` in PR body (Duong only)

### Rule 17 — Post-deploy smoke tests with auto-rollback (CLAUDE.md §17)

After deploys to staging and production, a `@smoke`-tagged Playwright subset runs. Prod failure triggers auto-rollback via `scripts/deploy/rollback.sh`.

**Enforcement:**
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` post-deploy steps `smoke-stg` and `smoke-prod`
- No bypass for prod smoke failures

## Smoke Test Tagging Convention

Smoke tests are Playwright tests tagged `@smoke`. They must:

1. Be **read-only** — no mutations to prod data
2. Exercise the **critical user journey** of the surface (the one path that must work for the app to be usable)
3. Complete in **under 60 seconds** total for all `@smoke` tests in a package
4. Be located in the package's `e2e/` or `tests/smoke/` directory
5. Carry a `@smoke` annotation in the test title or use `test.describe('@smoke', ...)` block

**Example (Playwright / TypeScript):**
```ts
test('@smoke — dashboard loads and shows run list', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  await expect(page.getByRole('heading', { name: /runs/i })).toBeVisible();
});
```

**Triggering smoke tests locally:**
```sh
npx playwright test --grep @smoke
```

**CI trigger:** The deploy workflow runs `npx playwright test --grep @smoke` against the live staging/prod URL after each deploy step.

## Hook Installation

Run once per clone (or after pulling new hook scripts):

```sh
bash scripts/install-hooks.sh
```

This installs dispatcher hooks at `.git/hooks/pre-commit` and `.git/hooks/pre-push`. Each dispatcher runs all `scripts/hooks/<verb>-*.sh` scripts in sorted order, composing the secrets guard, artifact guard, and TDD hooks.

**Active sub-hooks:**
| File | Verb | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| `pre-commit-artifact-guard.sh` | pre-commit | Blocks large binary artifacts |
| `pre-commit-secrets-guard.sh` | pre-commit | Blocks raw `age -d` / secret reads |
| `pre-commit-unit-tests.sh` | pre-commit | Runs unit tests for staged TDD packages |
| `pre-push-tdd.sh` | pre-push | Enforces xfail-first + regression-test rules |

---

## Branch Protection Requirements

After all CI workflows are on `main`, run `scripts/setup-branch-protection.sh` to make these checks **required** for merge:

- `xfail-first check` (tdd-gate.yml)
- `regression-test check` (tdd-gate.yml)
- `unit-tests` (unit-tests.yml)
- `Playwright E2E` (e2e.yml)
- `QA report present (UI PRs)` (pr-lint.yml)

One approving review from an account other than the PR author is also required. Agents may never use `--admin` bypass.
