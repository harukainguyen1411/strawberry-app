# Delivery Pipeline — Credentials & Setup Runbook

One-time setup for the autonomous delivery pipeline shipped 2026-04-09.
Check off each section as you finish it. Everything here needs **your hands** — either your browser, your terminal, or a paste into a secret file.

All paid options have been removed. Free tier only.

---

## 0. Prerequisites on your Windows computer

The three local workers (`discord-relay`, `coder-worker`, `bee-worker`) run on your always-on Windows box. Install these once:

- [ ] **Git for Windows** — `winget install Git.Git` (includes Git Bash + MSYS `flock`)
- [ ] **Node 20+** (per-user install, NOT system-wide, so `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\` OAuth resolves under NSSM) — `winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS` then confirm `node --version` shows 20+
- [ ] **GitHub CLI** — `winget install GitHub.cli`, then `gh auth login` with the account that has access to the app repo
- [ ] **Claude Code CLI** — `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`, then `claude` once to complete the Max-subscription OAuth login. **This must be logged in as YOU (Max plan), not via API key.**
- [ ] **NSSM** (service supervisor) — `winget install NSSM.NSSM`
- [ ] Optional: **Cursor** as editor — you already use it

---

## 1. GitHub repo security hardening (run in YOUR terminal)

You must run these as the repo owner (`Duongntd`). The collaborator PAT lacks admin scope.

```bash
gh api -X PUT "repos/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}/vulnerability-alerts"
gh api -X PUT "repos/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}/automated-security-fixes"
gh api -X PATCH "repos/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}" \
  -f security_and_analysis.secret_scanning.status=enabled \
  -f security_and_analysis.secret_scanning_push_protection.status=enabled
```

- [ ] Ran the three commands above
- [ ] Confirmed at `https://github.com/$GITHUB_REPOSITORY/settings/security_analysis` that Dependabot alerts, security updates, secret scanning, and push protection all show **Enabled**

---

## 2. Rotate the triage PAT to remove `workflow` scope

**Why:** the current `secrets/github-triage-pat.txt` has `repo` + `workflow` scopes. The `workflow` scope lets any process holding the PAT rewrite `.github/workflows/*.yml` and silently remove the `validate-scope` guardrail. Drop `workflow`.

- [ ] Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
- [ ] Find the token labeled `strawberry-agents` (or whatever you named it)
- [ ] Click **Edit**
- [ ] **Uncheck** the top-level `workflow` box
- [ ] Leave `repo` (full) checked
- [ ] Click **Update token** at the bottom
- [ ] No need to re-paste — the token string is unchanged, just the permissions narrowed

---

## 3. Branch protection on `main`

**Why:** makes the approval gate an *enforced* control. Without branch protection, any collaborator with push access can bypass review procedurally.

The exact JSON payload is pending Pyke's review (he's auditing Fiora's draft right now). Once that lands, this section will contain the full `gh api PUT` command you paste into your terminal. Leave unchecked for now.

- [ ] `gh api PUT` command from Pyke/Fiora applied (coming soon)
- [ ] Confirmed at `https://github.com/$GITHUB_REPOSITORY/settings/branches` that `main` shows the rule with **Require a pull request before merging (1 approval)** + required status checks

---

## 4. Firebase project + service account (for MyApps deploys)

Katarina is setting up the Firebase project in parallel. Once she finishes, she'll paste the project ID here. Meanwhile, generate the service account JSON:

- [ ] Confirm the Firebase project ID (Katarina will report it — for now it's likely `strawberry-agents-discord` since we're reusing the same GCP project)
- [ ] Go to https://console.firebase.google.com → select the project
- [ ] **Project Settings** (gear icon top left) → **Service accounts** tab
- [ ] Click **Generate new private key** → **Generate key** → download the JSON file
- [ ] Open the downloaded JSON in Cursor — copy the ENTIRE content (it's a JSON object)
- [ ] Go to `https://github.com/$GITHUB_REPOSITORY/settings/secrets/actions`
- [ ] Click **New repository secret**
- [ ] Name: `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_MYAPPS_B31EA` (exact name — Fiora's workflows reference this string)
- [ ] Value: paste the whole JSON content (including the curly braces)
- [ ] Click **Add secret**
- [ ] **Delete the downloaded JSON file from your Downloads folder** — gitleaks will not catch this, and we do not want it sitting on disk

⚠️ Pyke flagged: scope this service account to **Firebase Hosting Admin** only (not Project Editor). Two options:

**GCP Console (visual):**
1. https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam?project=strawberry-agents-discord
2. Find the SA you generated (e.g. `firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx@strawberry-agents-discord.iam.gserviceaccount.com`)
3. Click the pencil icon at the right → trash icon on any non-Hosting-Admin role → **+ ADD ANOTHER ROLE** → type "Firebase Hosting Admin" → Save
4. Verify: the principal shows exactly one role, `Firebase Hosting Admin`

**gcloud CLI (faster):**
```bash
SA="firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx@strawberry-agents-discord.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
PROJECT="strawberry-agents-discord"
gcloud projects remove-iam-policy-binding "$PROJECT" \
  --member="serviceAccount:$SA" --role="roles/editor"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding "$PROJECT" \
  --member="serviceAccount:$SA" --role="roles/firebasehosting.admin"
gcloud projects get-iam-policy "$PROJECT" --flatten="bindings[].members" \
  --filter="bindings.members:$SA" --format="value(bindings.role)"
# Should output exactly: roles/firebasehosting.admin
```

---

## 5. Discord bot token (already done, verify only)

- [x] `secrets/discord-bot-token.txt` is populated with the Evelynn bot token
- [x] `MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT` enabled on the Evelynn bot app

Nothing to do here unless something breaks.

---

## 6. Gemini API key (already done, verify only)

- [x] `secrets/gemini-api-key.txt` is populated
- [x] Verified working via smoke test — Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite returned a triage verdict

Nothing to do here unless Gemini free tier changes.

---

## 7. Secrets file checklist

Your `secrets/` folder should now contain exactly these files (all gitignored):

- [ ] `secrets/gemini-api-key.txt` — live, working
- [ ] `secrets/discord-bot-token.txt` — live, working
- [ ] `secrets/github-triage-pat.txt` — live, working (narrowed to `repo` only in §2)
- [ ] `secrets/firebase-service-account.json` — pre-existing, needs confirmation it matches the one in §4 OR is a separate file used by the `bee-worker` Admin SDK subscription
- [ ] `secrets/recipients.txt` — age encryption recipients (unrelated, pre-existing)
- [ ] `secrets/encrypted/` — age-encrypted secrets, pre-existing

**Nothing else should exist in `secrets/`.** If you see stale files (e.g., old `agent-github-token`), delete them.

---

## 8. GitHub Actions Secrets checklist

Go to `https://github.com/$GITHUB_REPOSITORY/settings/secrets/actions` and confirm these are set:

- [ ] `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_MYAPPS_B31EA` — from §4
- [ ] `AGENT_GITHUB_TOKEN` — already set per Fiora's earlier note, used by the auto-label and (future) contributor-pipeline workflows

You should NOT need these (they were considered and rejected):
- ~~`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`~~ — not used, coder-worker runs locally on Max
- ~~`GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER`~~ — not used, no Cloud Run deploys anymore

---

## 9. Windows worker installation (after §0 prerequisites)

### 9a. Create .env files from secrets

The install scripts require `.env` files to exist before running. Create them from the secrets directory (run in Git Bash from the repo root):

```bash
# discord-relay
{
  printf 'GEMINI_API_KEY='
  tr -d '\r\n' < secrets/gemini-api-key.txt
  printf '\nDISCORD_BOT_TOKEN='
  tr -d '\r\n' < secrets/discord-bot-token.txt
  printf '\nGITHUB_TOKEN='
  tr -d '\r\n' < secrets/github-triage-pat.txt
  printf '\nTRIAGE_DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID=1489570533103112375\nPORT=8080\n'
} > apps/discord-relay/.env

# coder-worker
{
  printf 'GITHUB_TOKEN='
  tr -d '\r\n' < secrets/github-triage-pat.txt
  printf "\nTRIAGE_TARGET_REPO=${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}\nPOLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS=60\nMAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS=1\n"
} > apps/coder-worker/.env
```

### 9b. Grant SYSTEM read access to .env files

NSSM runs services as the SYSTEM account by default. The `.env` files need to be readable by SYSTEM (run in elevated PowerShell):

```powershell
icacls "C:\Users\AD\Duong\strawberry\apps\discord-relay\.env" /grant "SYSTEM:(R)"
icacls "C:\Users\AD\Duong\strawberry\apps\coder-worker\.env" /grant "SYSTEM:(R)"
```

### 9c. Add repo to git safe.directory for SYSTEM

Git blocks SYSTEM from accessing repos owned by another user. Add an exception to the system-wide git config (run in elevated PowerShell):

```powershell
Add-Content "C:\Program Files\Git\etc\gitconfig" "`n[safe]`n`tdirectory = C:/Users/AD/Duong/strawberry"
```

### 9d. Run the install scripts (elevated PowerShell)

Run each install script from an **elevated PowerShell** (right-click PowerShell → Run as administrator). Use `sc.exe` not `sc` — PowerShell aliases `sc` to `Set-Content`.

**discord-relay:**
- [ ] `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File apps\discord-relay\scripts\windows\install-discord-relay.ps1`
- [ ] `Start-Sleep 8; sc.exe query StrawberryDiscordRelay` — verify `STATE: 4 RUNNING`

**coder-worker:**
- [ ] `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File apps\coder-worker\scripts\windows\install-service.ps1`
- [ ] `Start-Sleep 8; sc.exe query StrawberryCoderWorker` — verify `STATE: 4 RUNNING`

**bee-worker** (sister-agent Firebase queue worker):
- [ ] Deferred — ship after the MyApps pipeline is proven

### 9e. Cloudflare Tunnel (permanent webhook URL)

Install cloudflared and create a named tunnel so the webhook URL survives reboots.

```powershell
# Install cloudflared
winget install --id Cloudflare.cloudflared --accept-source-agreements --accept-package-agreements

# Log in (opens browser — authorize darkstrawberry.com)
cloudflared login

# Create the tunnel
cloudflared tunnel create strawberry-webhook

# Route webhook.darkstrawberry.com to this tunnel
cloudflared tunnel route dns strawberry-webhook webhook.darkstrawberry.com
```

Write `C:\Users\AD\.cloudflared\config.yml`:
```yaml
tunnel: <tunnel-uuid>
credentials-file: C:\Users\AD\.cloudflared\<tunnel-uuid>.json

ingress:
  - hostname: webhook.darkstrawberry.com
    service: http://localhost:9000
  - service: http_status:404
```

Install and start as NSSM service (elevated PowerShell):
```powershell
$cf = (Get-Command cloudflared).Source
nssm install cloudflared-tunnel $cf "tunnel run"
nssm set cloudflared-tunnel AppStdout "C:\Users\AD\Duong\strawberry\apps\deploy-webhook\logs\cloudflared-stdout.log"
nssm set cloudflared-tunnel AppStderr "C:\Users\AD\Duong\strawberry\apps\deploy-webhook\logs\cloudflared-stderr.log"
nssm set cloudflared-tunnel AppRestartDelay 5000
nssm set cloudflared-tunnel Start SERVICE_AUTO_START
sc.exe start cloudflared-tunnel
```

GitHub webhook payload URL: `https://webhook.darkstrawberry.com/webhook`

### 9f. Keep the computer on

The services run on this machine, not in the cloud. The computer must stay on (not sleep). Go to **Settings → System → Power & sleep** and set sleep to **Never** when plugged in.

To check service health at any time:
```powershell
sc.exe query StrawberryDiscordRelay
sc.exe query StrawberryCoderWorker
```

To tail logs:
```powershell
Get-Content "C:\Users\AD\Duong\strawberry\apps\discord-relay\logs\stdout.log" -Tail 20 -Wait
Get-Content "C:\Users\AD\Duong\strawberry\apps\coder-worker\logs\stdout.log" -Tail 20 -Wait
```

## 10. End-to-end smoke test

After steps 1–9 are green:

- [ ] Post a new post in Discord `#suggestions`: "The read tracker streak counter resets when I cross midnight Vietnam time"
- [ ] Verify: Gemini triages → GitHub issue filed with labels `myapps` + `bug` + `area/read-tracker` + `ready`
- [ ] Verify: coder-worker picks up the `ready` label within ~60 seconds
- [ ] Verify: coder-worker opens a PR with label `bot-authored`, branch `bot/issue-{number}`
- [ ] Verify: `firebase-hosting-pr-preview` workflow runs and comments a preview URL on the PR
- [ ] Click the preview URL → verify MyApps loads with the fix applied
- [ ] Review the diff tab of the PR (not just the preview URL — install-time and build-time attack surface lives in the diff)
- [ ] Click **Merge pull request** → **Squash and merge**
- [ ] Verify: `deploy-myapps-prod` workflow runs and deploys to Firebase Hosting live channel
- [ ] Open the live MyApps URL → verify the fix is live

---

## 11. Operational asks (ongoing)

Once the pipeline is live, when you review PRs authored by the coder-worker:

- **Always review the diff tab**, not just the Firebase preview URL. Preview shows runtime behavior; diff shows install-time (package.json, lockfile) and build-time (scripts, configs) changes — different attack surfaces.
- **Be extra cautious with PRs that touch `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, or anything outside `apps/myapps/`.** The `validate-scope` workflow blocks out-of-scope paths, but lockfile poisoning via a dependency update is a known supply-chain vector worth eyeballing.
- **If Claude's PR looks dense or weird, reject and re-run.** You're the gate.
- **Watch for prompt-injection exfil patterns.** Pyke REV 2 §11.6: a malicious issue body could try to steer Claude into `Read`ing files outside `apps/myapps/` (like `secrets/*.txt`) and exfiltrating their content via a commit body or a file written into `apps/myapps/`. Katarina's coder-worker scaffold locks this down at the tool level (drop `Bash` from allowed tools, restrict read paths where possible, log every tool call), but be alert if a PR has suspicious string literals in a commit message or contains base64-looking blobs in the diff.

---

## 12. Physical security on the Windows box (Pyke operational ask)

The Windows computer now holds long-lived production secrets (GitHub PAT, Discord bot token, Gemini API key) in plaintext and runs partly-untrusted AI-generated code. If the machine is stolen or compromised, those tokens go with it.

- [ ] **Enable BitLocker** on the system drive. `manage-bde -status C:` to check; Control Panel → BitLocker Drive Encryption if not already on. Recovery key: back up somewhere safe (NOT in the strawberry repo).
- [ ] **Real Windows login password** — no blank password, no PIN-only
- [ ] **Disable auto-login** — Settings → Accounts → Sign-in options → require sign-in "Every time"
- [ ] **Lock the screen when you walk away** — Win+L habit, or auto-lock after 5 minutes idle
- [ ] **Windows Defender real-time scanning** enabled (default, verify)
- [ ] **Automatic Windows Updates** enabled so kernel patches land without you thinking about it
